                    <h1>Summer School</h1>
                </header>
                <p>LabMGF team is proud to announce that this year marks the <b>11th edition</b> of the Summer School in
                    Geomatics, <i>Design and Implementation of Topographic Surveys for Territorial Monitoring in
                        Mountain Environments</i> </p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="../images/IMG_5857-1024x683.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>The <b>Summer School</b> provides students with <b>hands-on experience</b> in topographic land
                    monitoring in
                    mountain environments, a subject often covered only theoretically in regular classes. <br>
                    The summer school consists of an intensive week spent in the mountains at the Belvedere Glacier. It
                    will focus on surveying the whole glacier using <b>topographic techniques</b>, including <b>UAV
                        photogrammetry</b>
                    and <b>GNSS</b>. <br>
                    The summer school is integrated into a long-term monitoring project at the Belvedere Glacier. Since
                    2015, annual in-situ GNSS and UAV photogrammetry surveys have been conducted during previous
                    editions, creating accurate and comprehensive 3D glacier models. These models help determine glacier
                    velocity and volume changes over the past decade. <br>
                    You can explore the 3D models of the Belvedere Glacier, created from previous editions of the Summer
                    School, here: <a href="../potree/index.php" target="_blank">Belvedere Glacier 3D Models</a>. During
                    the Summer School, you’ll learn how to produce
                    similar 3D models yourself. <br>
                    This is the 11th edition of the Summer School: previous editions in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021,
                    2022, and 2023 took place at the Belvedere Glacier and in other places in the previous years.</p>
                <h2>How to participate?</h2>
                <h3>Where?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Summer School will be held at the Belvedere Glacier, a temperate debris-covered alpine glacier
                    located in the Anzasca Valley (Macugnaga – Italy). We will be based at the Zamboni Zappa Hut, a
                    mountain
                    hut next to the Belvedere Glacier at 2070 m a.s.l.</p>

                <h3>When?</h3>
                <p>The Summer School will be held from <b>Wednesday, July 24</b> to <b>Monday, July 29</b>, 2024.</p>
                <h3>Participation fee</h3>
                <p>Participants are required to pay a fee of <b>50 €</b> to cover administrative and tutoring expenses.
                    This
                    <b>does not include</b> the accommodation costs in the mountain Hut Zamboni Zappa and the meals
                    (<b>about 50
                        €/day</b> in total). The accommodation expenses will be paid directly at the Zamboni Zappa Hut
                    (note
                    that cash is required, as there is no internet connection at the hut, so electronic payment does not
                    work). Self-sufficiency in transportation is also required.
                </p>
                <h3>Applications</h3>
                <p>The Summer School is a part of the <b>Passion in Action</b> initiative organized by the
                    <b>Politecnico di
                        Milano</b>. Interested students are invited to register via the <a
                        href="https://www.polimi.it/corsi/didattica-innovativa/dettaglio-corso/summer-school-progettazione-e-realizzazione-di-rilievi-per-il-controllo-del-territorio-4"
                        target="_blank">Passion in Action application</a>.
                    Participation is open to the entire polytechnic community, with priority given to student
                    applications. <br>
                    The course requires a minimum of six students and can accommodate a maximum of twelve. Selection
                    will be based on exam grades and an initial interview with all candidates. Upon completion, students
                    will receive a certificate of attendance and will be awarded <b>3 CFUs</b>, which will be included
                    in the
                    Diploma Supplement attached to the degree. <br>
                    <b>Enrollment Period</b>: From May 13, 2024, to July 12, 2024, at 12:00 PM. <br>

                <h3>What do you need to participate?</h3>
                <p>The Summer School takes place in a <b>mountain environment</b>, at about <b>2000 m a.s.l</b>. <br>
                    No specialized gear is required to go to the glacier (no need for crampons, axes, ropes, etc.), but
                    you
                    will need <b>basic mountain equipment</b> to protect yourself from the weather. It can be
                    <b>cold</b> and <b>rainy</b> in the
                    mountains! <br>
                    Similarly, you don’t need to be a skilled mountaineer to take part in summer school. <b>Basic hiking
                        abilities</b> are sufficient for moving between the glacier and the Zamboni Hut and reaching the
                    surveying
                    sites, which can involve hiking with a backpack with an elevation gain of 300 to 400 meters in a
                    single
                    day. <br>
                    While movement skills in uneven and rocky mountain terrain (such as scree) are beneficial for
                    reaching
                    certain GPS measurement points within the glacier, these skills are not mandatory for participation,
                    as
                    we will be divided into groups to guarantee accessibility to all the activities. <br>
                <h4>Basic equipment includes:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A good pair of mountain boots</li>
                    <li>A good shall jacket for protecting from wind and rain (e.g., GORE-TEX shell or similar)</li>
                    <li>A good amount of warm clothes (e.g., piles, thermical underwear, synthetic t-shirts, a pair of long and short pants, socks, gloves, beanie)</li>
                    <li>A liner mummy to sleep in the hut (you can also buy it there, but better to buy it before)</li>
                    <li>Suncream and sunglasses</li>
                    <li>Basic things for personal hygiene</li>
                    <li>Water bottle</li>
                    <li>A headlamp for the evening</li>
                </ul>
                Suggested: smaller backpack for daily activities, trekking poles and a pair of comfortable hiking shoes.
                Note that the mountain hut is not a hotel but a <b>high-alpine hut</b>. You will sleep in common rooms
                with the
                other students, there will be no internet connection and only the basic facilities, but you will spend
                <b>one week in an amazing place</b>.

                </p>
