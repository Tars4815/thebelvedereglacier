                </header>
                <p>This project aims at a thorough and accurate <b>4D monitoring</b> of the Belvedere Glacier with
                    <b>photogrammetric approaches</b>, exploiting different spatial (<b>from centimetric to metric</b>)
                    and temporal
                    resolution (<b>from daily to 10-year periods</b>) and with different platforms (<b>UAVs, aerial
                        photogrammetry, terrestrial time-lapse cameras</b>). <br>

                    <b>Since 2015</b>, an extensive and continuous monitoring activity was carried out with
                    <b>UAVs-based
                        photogrammetry</b> and <b>in-situ GNSS measurements</b> (Ioli et al, 2022). Every year,
                    fixed-wing UAVs and
                    quadcopters were used to remotely sense the glacier and build high-resolution photogrammetric models
                    in order to estimate annual variations of ice volume and ice flow velocities. <br>

                    The monitoring activity carried out on the Belvedere Glacier was designed and conducted jointly by
                    the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (<b>DICA</b>) of Politecnico di Milano and the
                    Department of Environment, Land and Infrastructure Engineering (<b>DIIATI</b>) of Politecnico di
                    Torino.
                    The <b>DREAM</b> projects (DRone tEchnnology for wAter resources and hydrologic hazard Monitoring),
                    involving teachers and students from Alta Scuola Politecnica (<b>ASP</b>) of Politecnico di Torino
                    and
                    Milano, contributed to the campaign from 2015 to 2017. <span class="image right"><img src="../images/old-photos.jpg" alt="" /></span><br>

                    Moreover, to reconstruct the <b>long-term evolution</b> of the glacier, from 1977 up to now, we used
                    <b>historical images</b> acquired for regional mapping purposes. Historic <b>analog</b> images were
                    <b>digitalized</b>
                    and processed with a modern photogrammetric approach to derive the glacier 3D morphology in 1977,
                    1991 and 2001 (De Gaetani et al., 2021). <br>
                    Currently, <b>two time-lapse cameras</b>, permanently installed at the NW glacier terminus, are
                    being used
                    to derive <b>daily 3D glacier movements</b> and changes in the ice structures (such as ice falls and
                    calving events).
                </p>
                <h2>Low-cost stereo-photogrammetry and Deep Learning for 4D monitoring of an alpine glacier</h2>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/stereo-cam.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Time-lapse cameras are frequently used to retrieve information on glacial flows. However, only one
                    camera is often employed, preventing photogrammetric reconstructions. To monitor sub-seasonal
                    movements of the glacier, we designed a <b>low-cost stereoscopic system</b> composed of <b>two
                        time-lapse
                        cameras</b> for monitoring the north-west tongue of the Belvedere Glacier. <br>
                    The stereoscopic system was realized in collaboration with the students of the <a
                        href="https://www.asp-poli.it/kuoleva-j%d3%93%d3%93tikk%d3%a7/" target="_blank">Kuoleva
                        Jäätikkö</a>
                    project of the Alta Scuola Politecnica (ASP). <br>
                    Each monitoring station includes a <b>DSLR camera</b>, an <b>Arduino microcontroller</b> for camera
                    triggering,
                    and a <b>Raspberry Pi Zero</b> with a SIM card for sending images to a remote server. The
                    instrumentation
                    is enclosed in waterproof cases. During summer 2021, the two cameras were installed on each side of
                    the Belvedere Glacier terminal ice cliff and they are currently taking <b>daily images</b>. <br>
                    Due to the <b>wide baseline</b> (i.e., ∼260 m), traditional feature-based matching techniques (e.g.,
                    the
                    ones implemented in software such as Agisoft Metashape and based on SIFT-like descriptors) fail to
                    find enough homologous points for estimating the orientation of the cameras. State of-the-art
                    <b>deep
                        learning</b> matching methods, such a SuperGlue (Sarlin et al., 2020), outperform traditional
                    feature
                    based matching techniques. <span class="image right"><img src="../images/area_of_sudy_shaded.png" alt="" /></span><br>
                    Thefore, it was necessary to develop an ad-hoc pipeline for multi-temporal stereo reconstruction
                    with wide camera baselines: <b>ICEpy4D</b>. <br>
                    ICEpy4D is a multi-purpose Python package for 4D Image-based Continuos monitoring of glaciers’
                    Evolution with deep learning SfM and low-cost stereo-cameras and it is available at
