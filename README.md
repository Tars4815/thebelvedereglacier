App for the Belvedere glacier

## About

This repository contain the source code for the web data exploration platform connected to the Belvedere Glacier monitoring project conducted by [LabMGF](https://labmgf.dica.polimi.it/projects/belvedere/) at Politecnico di Milano.

The website allows users to access 2D and 3D data exploration solutions for querying and visualising products of a decade-long survey campaigns, including point clouds and GNSS ground control point measurements. The 2D webmap is built on top of [Leaflet.JS](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) library while the 3D exploration platform is implemented using [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree) and [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/).

The current version of the web platform can be accessed at the following link: https://thebelvedereglacier.it/
